# Health-Monitoring-System
This system allows users to keep track of their body vitals like blood pressure, sugar level, and heartbeat and remotely send the data to healthcare professionals.
It can measure one or more health data of a patient who is connected to the device such as heartbeat, body temperature, blood pressure, ECG, steps etc. 
The equipment can record, transmit and alert if there is any abrupt change in the patientâ€™s health.
IoT based Health Monitoring System is used where the patient and heath expert both are at different locations.
The system can be designed to send alerts or notifications to the individual or caregiver in case of abnormal readings or health issues. 
For instance, if the blood pressure reading goes beyond a certain threshold level, the system can send a notification to the individual and also to the healthcare provider for immediate attention.
